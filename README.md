# inContact Status Changer
I have created a AutoHotKey script for inContact. Itâ€™s a relativity simple application but makes changing your status quick and easy. It does require you to have installed the Power Agent though. This script will automatically find the inContact window and change it to the desired status. Below are the listed hot keys and what they do. I did my best to make the letters are logical as I could. 



## Status Hotkeys

All shortcuts are prefaced with ALT+[hotkey]

**Example:** ALT+q will change you to Unavailable. 

1. a = Available
2. q = Unavailable
3. c = Working Chat
4. u = Working Unassigned
5. b = Break
6. l = Lunch
7. m = Meeting
8. t = Training
9. w = Working Task
10. o = Working Outage

## Nuances

*	If you hold the key down it will continue to execute the same command. There is no cool down so to speak. 

*	You agent window can be anywhere and even behind other windows. It will pull it to the front and change the status. 

*	This just uses a series of mouse clicks within the inContact window. 

*	It does sometimes miss to change the status. Hitting the keys again will start over.
